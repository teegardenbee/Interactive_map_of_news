Hi...This is my first project. I have created an interactive map using the folium library. 
The notebook that says Firstpost scraped is the notebook that scarapes the firstpost news websites and save the headings for the day to a text file.
The file that says current affairs mapped uses the folium library to visualise the relevant news articles(Articles that include a country name).
